# Low-Level Design Patterns in Python

This repository contains clean and beginner-friendly implementations of all major **Low-Level Design (LLD) patterns** using **Python**.

The main goal of this repo is to help developers understand, revise, and apply design patterns with real-world analogies ‚Äî especially useful for **LLD interview preparation**.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

The repository is divided into three main sections:

1. **Behavioral Patterns**  
   Patterns that define how objects communicate and interact.

2. **Creational Patterns**  
   Patterns that handle object creation mechanisms, abstracting the instantiation process.

3. **Structural Patterns**  
   Patterns that focus on how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures.

Each folder contains:
- Python implementations of the patterns
- A dedicated `README.md` with clear explanations
- Real-life relatable examples to make learning easier

## üéØ Why Use This Repository?

- ‚úÖ Beginner-friendly explanations
- ‚úÖ Real-life analogies for each pattern
- ‚úÖ Python-based examples for hands-on learning
- ‚úÖ Great for quick revision before interviews
- ‚úÖ Easy to understand even if you're new to LLD

---

## üë®‚Äçüíª Who Should Use This?

- Python developers looking to strengthen their OOP and design principles
- Interview candidates brushing up on LLD concepts
- Students or engineers looking to understand software design more deeply

## üìå Note from the Author

I‚Äôve put in my best effort to ensure each pattern is easy to understand and applicable. While there may still be room for improvement, my aim was to create a helpful resource for others like me.

> As a beginner, I hope this gives you a solid base in Low-Level Design and how to approach it using Python.

Feel free to **fork the repo**, make your own contributions, and revisit it before interviews as a quick brush-up.
